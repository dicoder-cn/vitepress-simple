# v1.1.0

> 2024-06-19

* 【New】Multilingual support. The software supports switching between Chinese and English.
* 【New】New terminal command function. Common commands can be run with one click on the program side. Currently, the following commands are supported:
  * Git-related commands, such as `add commit push pull`
  * Npm series commands, such as `install docs:dev build`, etc.
* 【New】When creating a new VitePress project, a built-in large image preview plugin is included. Clicking on an image displays the large image.
* 【Fixed】The problem that the form cannot be dragged normally under the macOS system.
* 【Modified】Modify the default VitePress version to v1.2.3
* 【Improved】Improve the storage logic of the VitePress configuration file. Add a `config` directory under the `.vitepress` folder:
  * `index.ts` Entry file
  * `vpsimple.ts` The file automatically generated and written by the VitePressSimple software. Users cannot modify it by themselves.
  * `custom.ts` Some configurations customized by the user. If the same fields as `vpsimple.ts` are configured, the configuration in `custom.ts` will be used preferentially.
