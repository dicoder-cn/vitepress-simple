## Document Code

> In VitePress, each Markdown file is compiled into HTML and treated as a Vue single-file component. This means that you can use any Vue features in Markdown, including dynamic templates, using Vue components, or adding logic to the page's Vue component by adding a `<script>` tag.

The code refers to the code within the script and style tags in the document. The program will automatically recognize the code in these two tags and fill it in the code area (the entire document should not have multiple script or style tags, as there may be unexpected issues during parsing).
