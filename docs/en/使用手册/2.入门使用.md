## Basic Document Configuration

As shown in the above figure, you can configure individual settings for the document.

The following fields are specifically explained:

**Outline Display Level**: When set to 0, the outline is not displayed; when set to 3, the outline can be displayed up to the third level.

## Document as Homepage

If you want the previously edited document to be the homepage, you can click the "Homepage" tab on the right side, and select "Homepage" as the page type.

Configure the basic information and features of this homepage.

## Document Code

> In VitePress, each Markdown file is compiled into HTML and treated as a Vue single-file component. This means that you can use any Vue features in Markdown, including dynamic templates, Vue components, or adding logic to the Vue component of the page by adding `<script>` tags.

Code refers to the code in the script and style tags of the document. The program will automatically recognize the code in these two tags and fill it into the code area (the entire document should not have multiple script or style tags, as unexpected events may occur during parsing).
