# Software Introduction

**Background**: Vitepress is a useful tool, but it requires manual configuration.

In order to achieve visual configuration for Vitepress, VitePressSimple (referred to as vpsimple) was created.

This tool allows for online editing of markdown documents, online management of document and project configurations, making your Vitepress project development faster.

While manual configuration in Vitepress is highly flexible, this tool follows the principle of "convention over configuration", which may have some limitations in terms of configuration. Please be aware of this.
