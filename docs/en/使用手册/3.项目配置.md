The configuration for languages is shown in the image above.**It is recommended to decide whether to use multilingual support at the beginning. Once decided, it is not recommended to delete languages, as deleting a language will also delete all configurations related to that language!**

The languages are listed above, and you can dynamically add or delete languages. When all languages are deleted, it means that multilingual support is not used by default.

The configurations below are specific to the selected language. When multilingual support is not used, the corresponding configurations are saved in the root configuration.

# Social Accounts
