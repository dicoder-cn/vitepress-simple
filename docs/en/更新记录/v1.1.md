# v1.1.0

> June 19, 2024

* **New** Multi-language support, with the software now capable of switching between Chinese and English.
* **New** Terminal command functionality, allowing one-click execution of common commands directly from the program. Currently supported commands include:
  * Git commands such as `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.
  * npm commands like `install`, `docs:dev`, `build`, etc.
* **New** Built-in large image preview plugin for newly created Vitepress projects, enabling users to view images in full size upon clicking.
* **Fixed** Issue where the window could not be properly dragged on macOS systems.
* **Updated** Default Vitepress version to v1.2.3.
* **Improved** Logic for storing Vitepress configuration files, introducing a new `config` directory within the `.vitepress` folder:
  * `index.ts` – Entry file.
  * `vpsimple.ts` – File automatically generated and written by VitepressSimple; users should not modify this file.
  * `custom.ts` – Allows users to define custom configurations. If a field is configured in both `vpsimple.ts` and `custom.ts`, the setting in `custom.ts` will take precedence.
